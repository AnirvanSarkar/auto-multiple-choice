## Overview

Auto Multiple Choice is a piece of software that can help you create and manage [multiple choice] questionnaires (MCQ), with automated marking. AMC is a free software, distributed under the [GPLv2+] license.

### Features

#### LaTeX formatting

Answers sheets are formatted with [LaTeX], allowing mathematical formulas and many other potential uses.

#### Shuffled questions and answers

AMC allows to shuffle randomly questions and answers within each question, so that each answer sheet is unique. Using this feature, it is more difficult for students to copy on their neighbour's sheets.

#### Automated marking from completed answers sheets scans

After the exam, AMC can mark the scanned answers sheets using its in-built Optical Mark Recognition (OMR). Without any scanner, or for sheets for which automated marking is not efficient, manual computer-aided data capture is available. One just has to click on boxes that are ticked on the completed sheets.

#### Marking

Even if a default scoring strategy is defined, very fine customisation is available for each question. AMC then outputs an OpenDocument sheet (for use with [LibreOffice.org] or [OpenOffice.org]) with all the results.
